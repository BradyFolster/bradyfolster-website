                Hi! I'm Brady Folster — an Information Technology & Web Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a strong interest in building practical, user-focused technology. I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, design, and problem-solving, and I'm always looking for ways to make digital experiences simpler and more intuitive, which is taught at a high level at RPI.
                <br><br>
                Right now, I'm exploring different areas of IT through coursework and hands-on projects, ranging from web development to data handling and UX design. I'm especially interested in roles that let me work across disciplines — collaborating with engineers, understanding user needs, and helping shape how a product evolves.
                <br><br>
                Long term, I'm working toward a path in product management, where I can combine technical understanding with communication, strategy, and team collaboration. I love thinking about why products work the way they do, how they can be improved, and what features would genuinely help users.
                <br><br>
                On teams, I'm someone who likes to break down problems, stay organized, and communicate clearly. I enjoy learning new tools, experimenting with small ideas, and supporting the people I work with.
                <br><br>
                Outside of tech, you can usually find me exploring music, working on personal projects, or keeping up with new apps, tools, and product trends.
                <br><br>
