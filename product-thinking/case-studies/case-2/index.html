                    <h2>The Senario</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2021, Google secured a ~$1.2B cloud-computing contract with the Israeli government as part of 
                        Project Nimbus. The deal generated internal and external controversy due to geopolitical concerns, 
                        and approximately 50 Google employees publicly protested the contract. Some protests impacted 
                        day-to-day workflow, and Google ultimately terminated the involved employees.

                <div class="projectbox">
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        How could Google have managed internal dissent, public perception, and contractual commitments in 
                        a way that protected both long-term reputation and business outcomes?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="projectbox">
                    <h2>Options Considered</h2>
                    <p>
                        Process with the contract unchanged (solid revenue, high reputational and internal culture risk)<br><br>
                        Renegotiate restrictive use clauses (Reduces internal conerns, preserves most business value, possible delays)<br><br>
                        Withdraw from the contract entirely (Eliminates reputational risk, significant financial and partner consequences)
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="projectbox">
                    <h2>Decision & Rationale</h2>
                    <p>
                        Renegotiating aspects of the contract would likely have created the most balanced outcome. By clarifying usage constraints 
                        or adjusting terms related to sensitive applications, Google could reduce internal pushback while meeting most of its 
                        contractual and revenue goals. <br><br>Terminating employees immediately created an abrupt escalation that introduced additional 
                        reputational risk. A more structured approach — such as facilitated dialogue, clear policy communication, or internal 
                        review channels — may have reduced operational disruption while maintaining trust with employees. <br><br>This option best 
                        aligns with Google's long-term priorities: maintaining a strong internal culture, protecting future government partnerships, 
                        and avoiding precedents that threaten large infrastructure deals.

                    <h2>Expected Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Short-term, Google would still face public and internal scrutiny, but a renegotiated deal paired with clearer 
                        communication would demonstrate responsiveness without fully abandoning contractual commitments. Long-term, 
                        Google would reinforce its positioning as both a reliable enterprise partner and an organization attentive to 
                        employee concerns — reducing the risk of future escalations.

                    <p>
                        This case study highlighted the complexity of balancing commercial obligations with employee sentiment, 
                        brand reputation, and geopolitical constraints. I learned how strategic decisions often require navigating 
                        multiple stakeholders whose needs may conflict, and how transparent communication and structured escalation 
                        processes can play a key role in maintaining organizational stability.
